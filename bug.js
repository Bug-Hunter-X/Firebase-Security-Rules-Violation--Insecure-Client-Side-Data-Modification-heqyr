The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to security rules and client-side data manipulation:

```javascript
// Client-side code
db.ref('users/' + userId).update({
  admin: true // Attempting to directly set admin privilege
});
```

This code attempts to directly set the `admin` property to `true` on the client-side.  However, this is insecure and likely to fail depending on your Firebase security rules.  Even if it initially works, it's easily exploited.
